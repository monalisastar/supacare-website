          SupaCare began where most others looked away â€” in the overlooked
          alleys, waste sites, and underserved communities. We saw not just
          problems, but possibilities: the opportunity to transform waste into
          dignity, data into carbon opportunity, and action into long-term
          climate solutions.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 max-w-xl mx-auto md:mx-0">
          From composting pilots to clean cooking access and digital waste
          tracking, our journey is rooted in the belief that small systems can
          spark systemic change. We're here to prove that local innovation can
          lead global transitions.
